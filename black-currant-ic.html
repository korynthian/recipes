        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups frozen black currants</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For the Ice Cream Base:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1&frac12; cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1&frac12; cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons high-quality vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Prepare the Black Currant Syrup:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen black currants and &frac12; cup of granulated sugar.</li>
                    <li>Cook over medium heat until the berries release their juices and begin to burst, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Once the mixture thickens slightly, remove from heat and let it cool completely.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Prepare the Ice Cream Base:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and &frac12; cup of granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and thick.</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan, heat the whole milk over medium heat until it reaches approximately 165&deg;F (74&deg;C). Avoid boiling.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour about &frac12; cup of the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously to temper the eggs.</li>
                    <li>Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk.</li>
                    <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. This forms a custard base.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Combine and Chill:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled custard base, heavy cream, the remaining &frac12; cup of granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and the cooled black currant syrup.</li>
                    <li>Whisk until thoroughly mixed.</li>
                    <li>Cover the mixture with plastic wrap, ensuring it touches the surface to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the mixture is very cold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Churn the Ice Cream:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If using an ice cream maker, ensure the bowl has been frozen according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions (typically 15&ndash;24 hours).</li>
                    <li>Assemble the ice cream maker and turn it on before adding the mixture to prevent the bowl from freezing up.</li>
                    <li>Pour the chilled mixture into the running ice cream maker.</li>
                    <li>Churn according for 30&ndash;35 minutes, until the ice cream reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Freeze and Serve:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer the churned ice cream into an airtight container.</li>
                    <li>Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming.</li>
                    <li>Seal the container and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.</li>
                    <li>Before serving, let the ice cream sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly for easier scooping.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
